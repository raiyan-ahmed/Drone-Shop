//             <p>
//                 Props is a way to pass data to a react element and state is the
//                 data thet belongs to a react component. When state object is
//                 changed re-rendering of that component is occured. <br />
//                 Props are read only so whan some data is passed to a component
//                 that cannot be changed from the component to which it is passed.
//                 On the other hand state can be changed from a component. State
//                 change is asynchronous in behaviour.
//             </p>
