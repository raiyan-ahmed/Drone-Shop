//             <p>
//                 State is a object of a react component that holds some state
//                 i.e. values that control the behaviour of a component. State can
//                 be changed using this.setState and when state of a component is
//                 changed re-rendering of that component is occured. Using
//                 useState hook state can be manually initiated and an array is
//                 returned which contains a function and a variable that holds the
//                 state value. The function is used to change the value of the
//                 state. This can be done by calling the function with some value
//                 as parameter from different function, event handlers etc.
//             </p>
//         </div>
//     );
